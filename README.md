# Error Pages Projects

"copy" of an error page of two websites- Pixar and Dropbox.  
I used the inspect tool to understand the main design of the webpage and the different elements used so I can build it the same way on my own.  
I found the current used fonts and the ones I didn't find, I used another free font and design it as much as I can to be seemed the same.  
I used margin, padding, float and more css styles for the different boxes and "container" box to define the different properties.  
For the Pixar project I also used semantic HTML.
